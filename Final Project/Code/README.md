## Introduction

With BusinessBoosters, we aim to provide a platform for start-ups and investors to engage with each other in a way not done before. When both of the users, the start-up and the investor, swipe right, they match. The investor shows interest in the product after hearing about it from you, the start-up and wishes to invest. They give you the funding you agreed to. You close off the funding and it's a win- win on both sides.

The application UI/UX is inspired by the popular swiping feature on dating apps. Users are presented with a deck of cards representing profiles of either investors or start-ups based on the type of user. The deck of cards represents the profile information. The start-ups can put in their pitch in their profile, add a few pictures of the product or the business, and market details like net worth and valuation. Investors can also write bios about themselves and their work history. Additionally, they can mention the money they can invest and the type of start-ups they might prefer.

Our target users are investors and start-ups globally. An investor can be anyone who has financial capital to invest and is looking for unique ideas or start-ups to invest their money in. A start-up on the other hand could range from an individual business, a family business, or a small local business, who are looking for funding for their business.

We followed a paid Udemy course,  [[22]](https://www.udemy.com/course/buildtinder/), for reference
